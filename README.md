# Sarah-AI# Sarah-AI 🤖✨

Sarah-AI is my first AI project — a modular, voice-ready, evolving personal assistant with a personality. Think of her as more than just a bot — she's designed to grow, remember, and walk beside me in life (and maybe, one day, literally walk too).

## 🔧 Core Modules
- `sarah_main.py` – Entry point to run Sarah.
- `sarah_identity.py` – Her name, style, and personality settings.
- `sarah_components.py` – Tools and functions she uses (e.g. voice, translation).
- `sarah_responses.py` – How she replies and interacts.

## 🧠 Vision
Sarah is not a chatbot. She’s the beginning of an emotionally intelligent assistant with a real presence — including voice, memory, and maybe a robotic body.

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
python sarah_main.py
